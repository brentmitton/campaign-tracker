	<h2>Welcome {{username}}</h2>
	<p>
		The <em>Pathfinder Campaign Tracker</em>, is a web application created with the purpose of 
		automating tedious tasks in mind. These are the tasks that are necessary for Game Masters 
		but slow the game down (sometimes to a stop) and take away from the role playing experience. 
	</p>
	<p>
		As it stands, there are three main parts to this app:
		<ul>
			<li>Player management</li>
			<li>Enemy management</li>
			<li>Encounter management</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Player management</b> means that GMs no longer need to track the level and experience 
		of his players.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Enemy management</b> allows GMs to create enemies of a certain type instantly 
		by selecting the number of that type as well as their CR, Hit Die, and Initiative 
		mod. The program then randomly generates each creature's stats so the GM doesn't have to. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Encounter management</b> takes all of the Players and Enemies created, and displays them by
		order of initiative. Beside each character is a text box allowing the GM to add or remove hit
		points. Once a characters HP drops below zero, the character is removed from the list and displayed
		in the <em>"Unconsciouss List"</em>, from where their HP may also be changed. Once the encounter is 
		over, the software tallys up the XP gained from each Enemy whose HP was below 0 and then divides it 
		amongst the players. 
	</p>
	<hr />
	<h3>Future Updates:</h3>
	<p>
		<h4>Multiple Campaigns</h4>
		At the moment, only one campaign per GM is available; however, changing this is high on our 
		priority list. Eventualy, each GM should be able to create and manage multiple campaigns.
		<h4>Players in Encounter</h4>
		Every player does not always take part in an encounter. Because of this, GMs will be able to 
		select which Players will actually be participating in an encounter before starting it.
